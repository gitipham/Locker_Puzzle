Locker Puzzle : 
A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers are closed on the first day of school.
As the students enter, the first student, denoted as S1, opens every locker. Then the second student, S2, begins with the second locker, 
denoted as L2, and closes every other locker. Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker

until student S100 changes L100. After all the students have passed thru the building, and changed the lockers, which lockers are open?
